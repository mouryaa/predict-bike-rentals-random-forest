# predict-bike-rentals-random-forest
This project compares three different regression models to predict the number of bikes rented for a bike sharing system in Washington DC. The models used to predict include a linear regressor, decision tree regressor and a random forest regressor. Comparing all three models showed that the random forest had the least amount of error  on prediction.
